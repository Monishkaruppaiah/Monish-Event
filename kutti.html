            think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don‚Äôt like just because you think that it will look good on your resum√©. Isn‚Äôt that a bit like saving up sex for your old age?‚Äù This analogy comes from Warren Buffett. His point is that we should focus on finding a job that we genuinely enjoy and that suit our talents and inclinations. Many people stay in jobs they chose when they were in their early twenties, or jobs their parents convinced them to take. And they stay in their jobs year in, year out for decades, despite the fact that they gain neither substantial financial rewards nor professional recognition.
